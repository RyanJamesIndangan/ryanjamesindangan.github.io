   - Circular with glowing cyan border
   - Professional look!

## Steps to Add Photo

```

2. Click the "DevOS" button (bottom left)

## Troubleshooting

**Photo not showing?**
- Check file name is exactly: `profile-photo.jpg` (lowercase)
- Check it's in the `assets/` folder
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

**Photo looks weird?**
- Use a square photo for best circular crop
- Current photo is great - nice smile, good lighting!
- Make sure photo isn't too large (< 2MB recommended)

## Current Status

✅ Start menu expects: `assets/profile-photo.jpg`

❌ Need to add the actual photo file
